# Shardy - Clash of Clans || Deprecated!
- Old Discord Bot accessing the Clash of Clans APi.

# Information
```diff
- The development of Shardy has started around two years ago on a late night session with some friends.
- This Source is only for showcases and not meant to be used - IT DOES NOT WORK!
- NPM Modules outdated/ removed - old discord.js Version Code.
- The Bot is hardstucked in a VPS we have lost access to, if still want to use it, invite: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=804784266344398888&scope=bot&permissions=8
```
- Ping/Help Commands are still working, however, the APi/Database commands are not.

# Rest in Peace
